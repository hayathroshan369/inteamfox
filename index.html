        <h1>7 Ways to make money on Club house</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">With millions of active users.Clubhouse is the perfect place for entrepreneurs.Read on
          to find out how people make money on Club house.</h5>

        

        <p class="w3-text-grey">Making money on social media is big business. People have been finding ways to monetize
          their social media accounts for years. And that won’t be changing with Clubhouse<br>
          In other words, Clubhouse is the next big thing in the realm of social networking apps.<br>
          In this guide, we’ll be discussing how to make money using the Clubhouse.Keep in mind that some ways to make
          money are a bit different from most social media platforms, whereas some remain the same.<br>
          Without further ado, here seven ways to make big money on Clubhouse:
          1. Pop-Up Shop<br>
          The first way to make money on Clubhouse is to sell something. If you have something to sell and you know you
          can sell it, this method is for you.<br>
          Starting a pop-up shop is all about creating a room, pitching products, and hoping people buy them. This
          method focuses more on driving traffic to a premade site where people can browse, purchase and more
          importantly, pay.<br>
          2. Run an AMA<br>
          So, you’ve built up a following on Clubhouse, and now you’re finally ready to monetize those numbers.<br>
          Run an ask me anything.<br>
          An ask me anything involves what it says on the label: You must merely answer questions put to you by the
          audience.<br>
          There are two ways to charge with AMAs.<br>
          The first is charing people to enter the room, in the first place, giving everyone who enters the chance to
          ask the one question their money buys.<br>
          The other way is to charge by the question, where followers need to donate to you before hearing their
          question.<br>
          3. Monetize Your Skills (Paid Training)<br>
          If you have any highly desirable skills, then it’s time to let those skills pay your bills.<br>
          By holding training sessions and charging an entry fee, your skills can start paying you back for all the time
          you spent learning in the first place.<br>
          Some of these highly desirable skills are worth more than others. Before you consider going down this route,
          we advise you to do some market research so you can see how much your skills are worth.<br>
          So, you’re not undercharging or overcharging, both of which have potential problems.<br>
          4. Sponsored Rooms<br>
          You may find that the answer to your money problems lies in the number of followers you have.<br>
          Big followings provide big business for you when it comes to sponsorships.<br>
          In exchange for promoting a brand, you get paid per the size of your business and following.<br>
          The audience participating in sponsored rooms could see product placements. And all that exposure and
          promotion, in exchange for a tidy sum that goes directly into your pocket.<br>
          5. Ad Placements<br>
          Podcasters are users that Clubhouse newcomers learn from. The main thing to be learned, for the sake of cash,
          is midroll advertisements.<br>
          So, during a Clubhouse room or event, a moderator may read out a message pre-agreed with advertisers, just
          like on radio shows.<br>
          6. Paid Guest Hosting<br>
          Hosting guests on a Clubhouse room with a large following can be a highly profitable endeavor.<br>
          It’s a known fact that businesses need to do whatever they can to connect with their target demographic.<br>
          As such, they shouldn’t be afraid to pay to play. An enterprise or a brand might ask you to host one of its
          representatives to allow the business to get out and in front of its target audience.<br>
          They need an advertisement? They have to pay.<br>
          Period.<br>
          7. Paid Access Events<br>
          Fancy yourself the next big talk-show host? Or a hard-hitting journalist, perhaps? Either way, paid events
          could be a godsend for you.<br>
          By hosting events that require paid access, you can make a modest fee per person, meaning the better you are
          at hosting the event, the more money you’ll be making.<br>
          It should be noted that this method can require a lot of pre-planning, booking guests that your audience wants
          to see, preparing an interview for them, and then delivering it to an event that may reach thousands of people
          eventually.<br>
          If you’re uncomfortable with this, then this method may not be for you.<br>
          <br>
          Conclusion<br>
          There are plenty of ways to make money from a good Clubhouse following, but your following matters in terms of
          how much you can expect to make.<br>
          We wish you the best of luck in your attempt to make money from Clubhouse.

        <h1>How Club house works?</h1>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">Now it’s time for me to breakdown how the Clubhouse app works exactly.<br>
          <br>
          Rooms<br>
          <br>
          Clubhouse is all about “Rooms”.<br>
          <br>
          Rooms are essentially audio-based chat rooms.<br>
          <br>
          Here’s an example:<br>
          <br>
          Clubhouse – Comedy club room<br>
          When you see a room in your feed, click on it. And you’ll join the room. In most cases, the room will have
          several moderators. Each of which leads the discussion.<br>
          <br>
          You can also create a private room. Just click on the little dot icon in the lower right corner of the app.
          And invite people to your private room.
        </p>

      <div class="w3-twothird">
        <h1>The stage</h1>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">When you enter a room, the people at the top of the room make up “the stage”.<br>
          <br>
          Club house – The stage<br>
          The stage is made up of people in the room with permission to speak.<br>
          <br>
          However, you’ll probably notice that most people on the stage are muted (noted by the crossed-out microphone
          icon).<br>
          <br>
          Club house – Muted speakers<br>
          One of the unwritten rules of Clubhouse is to mute yourself when you’re not actively in a conversation.

      <div class="w3-twothird">
        <h1>The audience</h1>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">Anyone not on the stage is in “The Audience”.<br>
          <br>
          The Audience is just like it sounds:people in the room that are there to listen. By default,<br> you’ll be in
          the audience whenever you enter a room on Club house.
        </p>

      <div class="w3-twothird">
        <h1>Starting a room</h1>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">To start a room, hit the green “Start a room” button on the app. You’ll then be able to
          add a title to your room. And invite people.<br>
          <br>
          Clubhouse – Start a room<br>
          And your room will go live. Just like that.<br>
          <br>
          Unless you have A LOT of followers on Clubhouse, it can take a while for people to join your room. So be sure
          to give it at least 15-20 minutes before giving up.<br>
          <br>
          Clubhouse also has a feature for scheduling rooms in advance. To do that, hit the calendar icon. Add details
          about your upcoming room.<br>
          <br>
          Clubhouse – Schedule an event<br>
          And your followers will get notified. That way, they can make a note to be around when your room starts.<br>
          <br>
          Raising Your Hand<br>
          <br>
          In most rooms, you’ll be muted by default when you join.<br>
          <br>
          If you want to chime in or ask a question, you can “raise your hand”.<br>
          <br>
          Clubhouse – Raise hand<br>
          The moderator can then put you on the stage to chime in. And unmute you.
