    <p> Okay, So what is it?Here's the gist: Imagine you have an app on your phone that lets you listen in on other
      people's live conversations.But not in a creepy way;these people want to be heard. They may even be famous, or at
      least interesting or knowledgeable(no guarantee,however).And you may be given the apportunity to join the
      chat.Think of it as an audio chat social network.Or as PCMag's Jordan Minor says in our review,"What if Twitter
      was a podcast you lived inside of?"<br>
      <br>
      When did it launch? Clubhouse launched(along with COVID in the US!)in March 2020.It became a big deal to a select
      few in part because of it's invite-only exclusively,much like a real-world club membership.In those early days ,it
      was a tiny community,mainly consisting of venture capatilists.After all,the company behind clubhouse-Alpha
      Exploration Co. -recieved a $12 million investment from Andreeson Horowitz after two months of existence.It was
      quickly worth $100 million-and it only had 1,500 users at the time.(Valuation for clubhouse as of April 2021:$4
      billion.)<br>
      <br>
      Where can i get the clubhouse app?<br>Clubhouse is currently available on iOS and Android.It launched on iOS last
      year,and the company started a US-only Android rollout in early May.As of May 21,it's availble on Android
      worldwide,and downloads of the Android version crossed 1 milllion in less than two weaks.
